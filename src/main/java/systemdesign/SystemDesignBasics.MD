Network
Peer to Peer: how to let hundreds of machines get the 10GB file from a file server? Use the Peer to Peer network.
Peer-to-peer, or P2P in its abbreviated form, refers to computer networks using a distributed architecture. 
In P2P networks, all the computers and devices that are part of them are referred to as peers, and they share and 
exchange workloads. Each peer in a peer-to-peer network is equal to the other peers. There are no privileged peers, 
and there is no primary administrator device in the center of the network.

The primary goal of peer-to-peer networks is to share resources and help computers and devices work collaboratively, 
provide specific services, or execute specific tasks. As mentioned earlier, P2P is used to share all kinds of computing 
resources such as processing power, network bandwidth, or disk storage space. However, the most common use case for 
peer-to-peer networks is the sharing of files on the internet. Peer-to-peer networks are ideal for file sharing because 
they allow the computers connected to them to receive files and send files simultaneously.
