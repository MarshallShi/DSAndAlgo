     * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other
     * elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
     * Output: [3,5]
     * Note:
     *
     * The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
     * Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using
     * only constant space complexity?

    //The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we can distinguish between them.
    // Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.
    //One important point is that by XORing all the numbers, we actually get the XOR of the two target numbers
    // (because XORing two duplicate numbers always results in 0).
    // Consider the XOR result of the two target numbers; if some bit of the XOR result is 1,
    // it means that the two target numbers differ at that location.
    //
    //Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other.
    // which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.
    //
    //Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i.
    //the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0.
    //the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.

    //Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group.
    // Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.
