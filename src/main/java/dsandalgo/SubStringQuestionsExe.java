     * Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input:
     * s = "aaabb", k = 3
     *
     * Output: 3
     *
     * The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input:
     * s = "ababbc", k = 2
     *
     * Output: 5
     *
     * The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
