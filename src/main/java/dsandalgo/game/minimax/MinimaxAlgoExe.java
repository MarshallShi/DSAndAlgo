     * https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/
     * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
     *
     * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
     *
     * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
     *
     * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game
     * when you guess the number I picked.
     *
     * Example:
     * n = 10, I pick 8.
     * First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
     * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
     * Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
     *
     * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
     *
     * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
     * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
